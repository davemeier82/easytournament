<h1>Manual statistics</h1>

<p>If you filled in the  <a href="games.html">Game reports,</a> you can evaluate all game events on this screen.</p>
<p>It is possible to sort the tables by clicking on the column headers.</p>
<p>With the two drop-down lists you are able to filter and group the events by team of player.</p>
<h2>Date / Playtime</h2>
<p>In the &quot;Date&quot; section you can filter the games by date an time. Right under this, in the section &quot;Playtime&quot;, statistics can be evaluated by the playtime (e.g. if only goals of the first half-time should be considered).</p>
<h2>Table heading</h2>
<p>The table heading is used for printing and HTML export.</p>
<h2>Add / remove game events</h2>
<p>With the buttons below the table on the left side (Add, Remove) you can add events, which should be evaluated.</p>
<p>In the column &quot;Game events&quot; it is possible to choose the event.</p>
<p>By selecting the checkbox in the column SP (Secondary Player) events of the secondary players will be evaluated (e.g. Assists).</p>
<p>The checkbox NO (Number of) is used to switch between evaluating the number of times the event occurs or the sum of points. (e.g. Football: if it is selected you get a 2 if two Touchdowns happened and 12 (2x 6 points) if it is no selected.</p>
<p>If the third checkbox WT (Wrong Team) is selected, an event is counted if an event is for Team A, but the player of Team B (e.g. Owngoals on event Goal). This checkbox has no effect to the result if SP is selected.</p>
<p>In the cell &quot;Label&quot; you can set an alternative column header. If this cell is empty the Game event name of column one will be used.</p>
<h2>Calculate statistic</h2>
<p>To show the set statistic you need to click on the &quot;Calculate&quot; button</p>
<h2>Export</h2>
<p>Additionally you are able to save the statistics with the &quot;Export statistic&quot; button as CVS (e.g. for spreadsheet applications as MS Excel) or as HTML file.</p>
