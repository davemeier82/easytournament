<h1>Schedule</h1>

<h2>Add game</h2>
<p>With the button &quot;Add game&quot; or the context menu (right mouse button) a single new game will be added to the schedule.</p>
<p>Now you can select the home position on the first column and afterwards the away position in the second column. Optionally you can edit the other cells.</p>
<p>The table will be sorted by date and time.</p>
<p>Referees are only selectable if they are added on the <a href="referees.html">referee</a> screen. If you don't plan to add any referees you can hide the referee column by deselecting the corresponding checkbox in the <a href="scheduleSet.html">settings</a>.</p>
<h3>Generate Games</h3>
<p><img src="images/game-generator.PNG" width="588" height="688" /></p>
<p>With the button &quot;Generate games&quot; you can open a dialog to create games for entire groups at once.</p>
<p>First you can select the groups for which you would like to create games. &quot;Number of encounters&quot; specifies how many games a team should have against every other team in the group.  (Home and away games will be created equally if possible).</p>
<p>By &quot;Break between games&quot; the games are generated under the assumption that there is no overtime. In the above example the second game begins at 19:40 (18:00 + 90 minutes regular game time + 10 minutes break).</p>
<p>If you select &quot;Maximum number of concurrent games&quot; you are able to set the number of available sports fields in this tournament.</p>
<p>By default there will be no team that has two consecutive games (There will be at least a break of one game). If you like to allow consecutive games, you can select &quot;Allow consecutive games of one team&quot;.</p>
<h2>Show team names</h2>
<p>The green marked button in the top most image allows to show the team names instead of the position. This of course only works if the teams are assigned to a group (see <a href="groupassignment.html">Group assignment</a>).</p>
<h2>Filter schedule</h2>
<p>It is possible to filter the schedule entries (by Group, Team or Referee) with the red marked drop down list in the top most image.</p>
<h2>Export</h2>
<p>The schedule can be saved as CSV (e.g. for spreadsheet applications as MS Excel) or as HTML file by selecting the menu &quot;File&quot;-&gt;&quot;Export...&quot;. In the opening dialog you need to choose &quot;Schedule&quot;.</p>
<p>In the saving dialog (see next image) you can choose the desired filetype.</p>
