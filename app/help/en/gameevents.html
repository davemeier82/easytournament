<p>This screen allows you to define game events which   later on can be selected in the game reports and evaluated in the <a href="../de/statistics.html">statistic screen</a> (e.g. scorer list).</p>
<p>With the drop-down list on the right side you can switch between the sports. If you have created some events in another tournament you can import them  with the import button.</p>
<p>You can move the game events by drag an drop to your tournament (left side) or you can use the arrow button. To delete an event click on the delete button or press the delete key.</p>
<h2>New event / edit event</h2>
<table width="200" border="0" cellspacing="5">

<h3>Name</h3>
<p>The name of the event (e.g. Goal, Offside, ...). If you edit a default event the name is not editable to preserve the translation property. Events created by yourself will be show with the same name in every language.</p>
<h3>Type</h3>
<p>Category of the event: Goal, Penalty or Other</p>
<h3>Points</h3>
<p>Number of points that this event counts (e.g. 1 for a goal in soccer or 6 for a touchdown in Football).</p>
<h3>Secondary player</h3>
<p>For some events so called secondary players are interesting. E.g. in icehockey you would like to know  how many assists a player scored to create a scorer list. Or maybe you would like to know which player has been fouled the most in soccer.</p>
