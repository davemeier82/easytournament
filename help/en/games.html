<p>This table is very similar to the one in the <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> screen. It shows the team names instead of the positions and has two additional score columns.</p>
<p>The table is ordered according the date and time.</p>
<p>With the checkbox in the first column you can set if a game is played of not.</p>
<p>Refrees are only selectable if they are added on the <a href="refrees.html">refree</a> screen. If you don't plan to add any refrees you can hide the refree column by deselecting the corresponding checkbox in the <a href="scheduleSet.html">settings</a>.</p>
<h2>Enter score</h2>
<p>There are 3 different ways to enter a score.</p>
<h3>Enter only the final score</h3>
<p>To do this you just have to click into the corresponding score cell and enter the number.</p>
<p>This is the easiest way, but has the disadvantage that you can only evaluate the team goal statistic.</p>
<h3>Enter score per period</h3>
<p>With a doubleclick or the context menu (right mouse button) you can open the game dialog (see next image).</p>
<p><img src="images/game-detail2.PNG" width="1000" height="600" /></p>
<p>On the left side you can enter the results per period. The final result will be calculated automatically. If the game goes in an overtime or a penalty shootout select the corresponding checkbox.</p>
<p>This way of entering results has the same disadvantage as the last one: only team goal statistics are available.</p>
<h3>Create a game report</h3>
<p>This is the most involved way but provides a lot of statistics and a printable game report.</p>
<p>With a doubleclick or the context menu (right mouse button) you can open the game dialog (see next image).</p>
<p><img src="images/game-detail.PNG" width="1000" height="600" /></p>
<p>On the right side you can add game events by clicking on the &quot;Add&quot; button or the corresponding entry in the context menu (see next image).</p>
<p><img src="images/add_event.PNG" width="715" height="490" /></p>
<p>In a first step you choose one of the events which you have defined in the <a href="gameevents.html">game events</a> tab. Afterwards enter the playtime in which the event happened (<strong>Caution</strong>: Events that happen in the additional time have to be entered in the last minute of the regular time (e.g. a goal in the 45+1 minute of the first half time has to be entered at  45 minutes and 0 seconds) otherwise they are added to the next period). In a next step you choose the team for which the event happened (e.g. the scoring team or the the team that receives a yellow card). Now you can add the players by drag and drop or with the arrow buttons to the boxes on the left side.</p>
<h4>Special case owngoal</h4>
<p>If player X of team A scores an owngoal, you can enter this as follows: Event: Goal, Team: Team <strong>B</strong>, Player: X of Team <strong>A</strong></p>
<h3>Edit game report</h3>
<p>With a double click on the event or by selecting the corresponding entry in the context menu (right mouse button) you can edit an event.</p>
<h2>Export</h2>
<p>The games can be saved as CSV (e.g. for spreadsheet applications as MS Excel) or as HTML file by selecting the menu &quot;File&quot;-&gt;&quot;Export...&quot;. In the opening dialog you need to choose &quot;Results&quot;.</p>
<p>In the saving dialog (see next image) you can choose the desired filetype.</p>
<p><img src="images/save.PNG" alt="" width="508" height="365" /></p>
<h3> Export game report</h3>
<p>If you have entered a game report you can save it as CSV or HTML by clicking on the &quot;Export...&quot; button below the report.</p>
